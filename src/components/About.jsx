          <p>
            My name is <span className="font-semibold">Huzeyfa Ahmed</span>, and I am a
            passionate <span className="font-semibold">Software Engineer</span>{" "}
            with a strong focus on building modern, scalable, and user-friendly web
            applications.
          </p>

          <p>
            I graduated with a degree in Software Engineering and have hands-on experience
            working with technologies such as <span className="font-semibold">
            React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS</span>. I enjoy turning
            complex ideas into clean, efficient, and maintainable solutions.
          </p>

    

          <p>
            Beyond coding, I value <span className="font-semibold">clean architecture,
            performance, and good user experience</span>. I am constantly learning new
            technologies and improving my skills to stay up-to-date with modern web
            development practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am currently open to <span className="font-semibold">
            junior to mid-level developer roles, freelance projects, and collaboration
            opportunities</span> where I can contribute, grow, and create impactful
            digital solutions.
